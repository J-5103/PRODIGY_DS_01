# Population Distribution Visualization üåçüìä
This repository presents a project on visualizing the age distribution within a population using Python and Matplotlib. The bar chart created here offers a clear breakdown of age groups, making it easy to analyze demographic patterns within the data.

## Project Highlights
Data Simulation: Synthetic data is generated to represent a sample population with age values.
Age Grouping and Visualization: Population ages are segmented into intervals, and a bar chart is used to display the frequency of each age group.

## Demographic Insights
This project highlights how simple visualizations can make complex demographic data easily interpretable.

## Skills Demonstrated
Data Visualization and Chart Design with Matplotlib
Data Grouping and Aggregation for age-based segmentation
Insight Generation to identify population trends
Inspired by real-world experience, this project demonstrates the value of visualization for revealing demographic distributions, helping analysts and stakeholders make informed decisions.
